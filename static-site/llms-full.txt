# GoodWatch — Full Site Documentation for AI

## About GoodWatch

GoodWatch is a movie recommendation app built to solve one problem: decision fatigue. When you have 2 hours to watch something and 25,000+ titles to choose from, you end up spending 30 minutes browsing and then rewatching The Office. GoodWatch fixes this by giving you exactly ONE recommendation — not a list, not a carousel, just one perfect pick.

### How It Works
1. Tell us your mood (happy, thrilled, chill, emotional)
2. Pick your moment (quick escape or movie night)
3. Get one perfect recommendation based on your mood, time, and streaming platforms
